# DecisionTreeClassifier
   This project is focused on building a decision tree classifier from scratch
   using Python, utilizing an algorithmic approach to construct a robust decision
   tree model.
##Overview
    The decision tree classifier is a popular and interpretable machine learning 
    algorithm that recursively partitions the feature space to make decisions. It 
    leverages splitting criteria like information gain or Gini impurity to
    construct a tree-like model of decisions and their consequences.
##Requirements
    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn (optional for comparison)
